# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

For this challenge assignment I was tasked with creating a back end to an E-Commerce platform. The E-Commerce platform was developed on the front end and starter code was provided. I established models and routes to work in tandem with the platform to help organize the site for the user. When the user interacts with my routes and models using Insomnia they are able to filter their data by category, product, and tag. The user can add, sort, and delete products, categories, and tags using Insomnia.
